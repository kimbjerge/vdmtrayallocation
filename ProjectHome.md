This is a project example of modelling with VDM++. The project is created as part of lectures in VDM++ at the Aarhus school of engineering spring 2010. The project contains a model of a sortation system for post or parcels with focus on allocation of empty trays on the sorter.

The sorter system consist of a number of trays on where a number of inductions are feeding items.

The inductions are grouped being able to overfill the trays and therefore the tray allocation algorithm must be optimize so the maximum throughput is reached without starvation of any inductions in the group.
