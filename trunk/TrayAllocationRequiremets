The purpose of this model is to model the tray allocation algorithm used to assign trays 
to parcels that is inducted onto the sortation machine. 

Parcels are inducted onto the trays belonging to the sorter. 

The sortation algorithm must assign a discharge in where the tray is tilted 
and the parcel is dumped depending on the barcode and sortation tables. 

R1. An induction is capable of induction a number of parcels 
    within a limited time interval (Eg. hitting each 2-5 trays passing an induction)
R2. Inductions is grouped in areas with 1-5 inductions in a group
R3. For each induction group the card reader detects the id of the tray
R4. A group of inductions are designed so the induction group is able to fill all trays
    that is passing the induction area
R5. The sorter has a number of trays on where parcels are inducted
R6. The sorter is running at a certain speed
R7. At optimal speed of sorter and induction all trays must be filled with parcels
R8. The tray allocation algorithm must be able to allocate empty trays to the 
    induction group so the sorter is filled with parcels optimal (No starvation)
R9. There must be maximum one item on any tray
    
R10. A barcode on the parcels is used to track it and decide on the discharge the parcel 
    is dumped
R11. There is a limitation on the number of parcels that can be dumped in a discharge
R12. A limited number of discharges is connected to the sorter
R13. Barcodes are looked up in sortation tables to decide on the discharge 
	to dump the parcel
	
Priority of work:

1. Design the tray allocation algorithm to fill the sorter with parcels for 
   a given configuration of an induction group (R1 - R9)

2. Design the sortation algorithm for dumping parcels in discharge (R10 - R13)
